# LogRhythm LogMessage Formatter
RustyRhythm *(Name is Work in Progress)* is a Chrome extension that enhances LogRhythm's WebConsole platform by reformatting log messages into a more readable and visually appealing format. It highlights important text â€” such as **usernames and IP addresses** â€” and restructures log messages for improved clarity.

**Built with:** Rust ðŸ¦€ + WebAssembly âš¡

# Installation
## **Add the Extension to Chrome**
1. Open Chrome and navigate to:
   **Extensions â†’ Manage Extensions**
2. **Enable Developer Mode** (toggle the button in the upper-right corner).
3. Click **Load Unpacked** and select the `pkg` folder.

---

## Install Dependencies

The extension can be installed under `releases` (TODO!). But if you want to compile it yourself, you'll need `Rustup` installed on your machine. Install it using:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

ðŸ”—[Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Then, install the required tools:
```sh
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo install wasm-pack
```

## Compile the Extension
Instead of using `cargo build`, run the provided build script:
```
sh build.sh
```
Once compiled, your extension files will be available in the `pkg` folder. This is the folder you need to import into Chrome.

# How to Use
1. Install the extension using the steps above.
2. The extension will automatically enhance the LogMessage box in the WebConsole.
3. Configure features via the config file.
4. Toggle features on/off from the extension dropdown menu.

# Demonstration
Test File for WASM
Before:

{"timestamp": "2024-02-06T12:35:10Z", "event": "file_access", "user": "john_doe", "file": "/etc/passwd", "ip": "192.168.1.1"},{"timestamp": "2024-02-06T12:35:10Z", "event": "file_access", "user": "john_doe", "file": "/etc/passwd"} unusefuldata

After RustyRythm:
```
{
  "event": "file_access",
  "file": "/etc/passwd",
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "timestamp": "2024-02-06T12:35:10Z",
  "user": "john_doe"
},{
  "event": "file_access",
  "file": "/etc/passwd",
  "timestamp": "2024-02-06T12:35:10Z",
  "user": "john_doe"
}
```
